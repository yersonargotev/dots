## On-demand context

Use the initiating retrieval result's explicit `surface` and `snapshot_id` for
this procedure and every nested request. Read and follow the linked Matty entry
at each authored call below; these links identify prepared Catalog Resources,
without requiring native Skill-tool registration or an installed sibling copy.
For a fresh nested descriptor, use:

```sh
packy get skill matty:<skill> --surface <initiating-surface> --snapshot <initiating-snapshot-id> --json
```

Keep that host and snapshot even if catalog selection changes. If retained
content is unavailable, stop and restore that exact revision rather than use a
newer snapshot or another Pack's same-name skill. Obtaining instructions does
not execute the procedure or satisfy its runtime or human prerequisites.

Resolve skill references and templates relative to this returned entry and
`resource_root`. Resolve project paths, repository inspection, and configuration
against the user's intended target project; choose writable scratch/output
separately from immutable Catalog resources. Preserve the procedure's invocation
policy, user decisions, and output destinations. Read only the references needed
for the active branch.

Write a handoff document summarising the current conversation so a fresh agent can continue the work. Save to the temporary directory of the user's OS - not the current workspace.

Include a "suggested skills" section in the document, naming suggested skills with their owning Pack and invocation policy. For an on-demand continuation, include the initiating host and snapshot and the qualified retrieval command. Suggestions are next-session recommendations, not dependencies or permission to invoke user-only skills.

Do not duplicate content already captured in other artifacts (specs, plans, ADRs, issues, commits, diffs). Reference them by path or URL instead.

Redact any sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, or personally identifiable information.

If the user passed arguments, treat them as a description of what the next session will focus on and tailor the doc accordingly.
